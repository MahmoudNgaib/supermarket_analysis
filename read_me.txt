# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python

This project applies practical EDA techniques on a tabular dataset using Python's libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data.

## Insights

1. Sales and Rating The analysis reveals that sales are not strongly correlated with rating, as indicated by the nearly horizontal regression line.

2. Unit Price and Sales There is a positive relationship observed between unit price and total sales, suggesting that higher unit prices may contribute to higher sales figures.

3. Seasonal Effect On February 13th, there appears to be a notable increase in sales, possibly due to seasonal factors or promotional events.

4. Gender Impact Females marginally outperform males in achieving sales.

5. Branch Performance All three branches show approximately equal sales volumes.

6. Sales Distribution The distribution of sales data is skewed to the right, indicating a concentration of higher sales values.

7. Rating Distribution Ratings exhibit a linear distribution pattern across the dataset.

## Conclusion

This EDA highlights various aspects of the dataset, including sales patterns, gender influence, and seasonal effects. Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib help uncover relationships and distributions within the data, providing valuable insights for further analysis and decision-making.

## Usage



Necessary libraries (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`).
